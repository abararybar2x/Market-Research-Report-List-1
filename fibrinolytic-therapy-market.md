<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fibrinolytic Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drug Treatment</li><li>Surgical Treatment</li><li>Other Treatment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fibrinolytic therapy encompasses various treatment approaches to dissolve blood clots that can obstruct blood vessels. Drug treatment primarily involves the use of fibrinolytic agents, such as thrombolytics, administered intravenously to rapidly dissolve clots. Surgical treatment may include procedures like catheter-directed thrombolysis, where a catheter is used to deliver drugs directly to the clot site, or surgical thrombectomy to remove the clot physically. Other treatment modalities may involve adjunct therapies, such as anticoagulants or mechanical devices for improved vein patency.</p></p>
